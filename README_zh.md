## Introduction<a name="section_introduction"></a>

The part of *Memory base libraries* belongs to the subsystem named *Utils Subsystem*. It provides the system library for upper-layer services to operate memory, ensuring the stability of upper-layer services.

## Memory Base Libraries<a name="section_libraries"></a>

*Memory base libraries* is a component of the system library that integrates memory operations and manages them in a unified manner.

### libdmabufheap system library<a name="section_libdmabufheap"></a>

The memory system library provides interfaces for services to allocate and share shared memory. By allocating and sharing memory between hardware devices and user space, zero-copy memory between devices and processes is implemented to improve execution efficiency.

### libmeminfo system library (planning)<a name="section_libmeminfo"></a>

It provides interfaces for memory usage queries. It is mainly used by memory footprint management service(hidumper) and low-memory killing service(lmks).

### libmemleak system library (planning)<a name="section_libmemleak"></a>

It cooperates with malloc_debug to detect memory leaks of native heap.

### libpurgeable system library (planning)<a name="section_libpurgeable"></a>

It provides management interfaces for discardable-type memory. It is mainly used by graphics and image codec libraries.

### libspeculative system library (planning)<a name="section_libspeculative"></a>

It provides management interfaces for speculative-type memory. It is mainly used by system services for data pre-loading.

## Usage Guidelines<a name="section_usage"></a>
